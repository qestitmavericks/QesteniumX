## :boom: Prerequisites

Before setting up the QesteniumX framework, ensure you have the following installed:

Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or newer
Maven 3.6.0 or newer
Latest version of Selenium WebDriver
## Installation

Clone the QesteniumX repository from GitHub:


```bash
  git clone https://github.com/qestitmavericks/QesteniumX.git

  cd cd QesteniumX
```
Use Maven to install dependencies and build the project:

```bash
 mvn clean install
```
    
## :boom: Configuration

Configure the framework to suit your project's requirements:

Edit the config.properties file to set up your base URL, browser preferences, and other configurations.
Customize logging levels and outputs in the log4j.properties file.

## Writing Tests

Write your test cases in the src/test/java directory.
Use the @Test annotation to denote test methods, and employ testNG features like data providers for data-driven testing.
## Running Tests

To run tests, run the following command

```bash
  mvn clean test
```


## :boom: Reporting

QesteniumX supports comprehensive reporting via Allure and Extent Reports, enhancing the visibility and analysis of test results.

Allure Reports
Generates interactive and detailed reports for test execution.
To generate Allure reports, ensure Allure is configured in your pom.xml, and execute:
```bash
  mvn allure:serve
```
This command will generate the report and open it in your default browser.

Extent Reports
Provides rich HTML reports with extensive details about test execution.
The framework is pre-configured to generate Extent reports in the test-output/ directory after test execution.
Open the HTML file in a browser to view the report.

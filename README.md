## üí• Prerequisites

Before setting up the QesteniumX framework, ensure you have the following installed:

Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or newer
Maven 3.6.0 or newer
Latest version of Selenium WebDriver

## üí• Installation

Clone the QesteniumX repository from GitHub:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/qestitmavericks/QesteniumX.git

  cd cd QesteniumX
```
Use Maven to install dependencies and build the project:

```bash
 mvn clean install
```
    
## üí• Configuration

Configure the framework to suit your project's requirements:

Edit the config.properties file to set up your base URL, browser preferences, and other configurations.
Customize logging levels and outputs in the log4j.properties file.

## üí• Writing Tests

Write your test cases in the src/test/java directory.
Use the @Test annotation to denote test methods, and employ testNG features like data providers for data-driven testing.

## üí• Running Tests
